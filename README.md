## Scripts:

`meta-analysis_urbanization.R`: script to run the actual multilevel meta-analyses and meta-regressions to test the relationship between urbanization and biodiversity, and the importance of the methodology used to estimate such relationship. The analyses are run using the R package '[metafor](http://www.metafor-project.org/doku.php/metafor)'. In addition, it contains code for testing publication and time-lag bias, and for generating plots.

### Notes:

29th March 2019: The script available now will likely be split in two: processing data script and analytical script.
